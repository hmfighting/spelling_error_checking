  To facilitate communication with relevant researchers, both code and data have been uploaded. Among them, there are two datasets to validate the model. One is the SIGHAN Bake-off dataset, the other is the logistics dataset. Since the logistics dataset is a private dataset provided by the logistics company, this part of data has not been uploaded. The main_word2vecPublic.py is the code to train and test the model. And the process_word2vecPublic is used to calculate the decision weight matrix and to process the data.  

  The word_vector file contains code to train the word vector model. Among them the word2vecModel is the model that has generated from the SIGHAN Bake-off dataset. The data file contains the original dataset and processed dataset.
